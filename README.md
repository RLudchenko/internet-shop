In order to launch the program you need to download Tomcat and configure it the next way:

You need to add a "war exploded artifact" and add build configuration. 
Together with this, you need to check URL, in my case, it is: http://localhost:8080/ 
but it can vary 
HTTP port: 8080 
JMX port: 1099 
Click apply and then press the start button.
